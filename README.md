TPOPFramework
=============

Framework for TPOP exercises

To implement a practical, make the package _com.tpop.practical.practical$NUMBER$_
where $NUMBER$ is an integer.

Implement exercises by implementing the __TPOPTask__ interface, for debugging
information, also use the __TPOPTaskMetadata__ annotation, however this is not required.

Edit the tpop.properties file to set the correct parameters for the framework,
_tpop.output_location_ is where the compiled .class files are found, with the root of that directory
containing the _com_ directory.
